# SINFONE

Developed for the class of Information Systems (EIC0040) at MIEIC, FEUP. 

SINFONE is a digital store for mobile phones and accessories. It was developed to integrate with and fully take advantage of Oracle's Primavera for product management.  

It should be noted that a separate project was developed to extend Primavera and function as an API for customized product management. This repository does *not* include the API, which must be properly configured prior to running the store.
